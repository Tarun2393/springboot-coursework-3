This application was build based on the springboot-course-3-complete project. 
This application considers a new feature for the user, which is the role.
There are three roles: Admin, User and Guest. A User has one role only.

Hint.- Review the User, Role and UserRole JPA classes located in the 
com.busyqa.course.jpa package.
